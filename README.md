## Welcome to GitHub Pages

I am learning...

This is pretty cool
because...
1. It's a frickin website
2. Nice

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

Reasons I'm the _best_:
- I can make a **website**
- I can do **java**

Code:
`public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Website");
}`
